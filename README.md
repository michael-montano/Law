# Law
* This repo contains law for public comment and community revision.
* It will be organized into categories of jurisdiction and kind.
* Remember that for domestic purposes there are four basic kinds of positive law: constitutional, statutory, regulatory, and judicial.
* Other documents emanating from government may also have the effect of creating rules of decision but are not law, strictly speaking. These are principally: legal opinion letters and official policies.
* So-called "secret law" is an oxymoron.
